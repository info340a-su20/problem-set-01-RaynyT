	<h1>Belle</h1>

	<p>Belle is one of the original Disney princesses whose story can be witnessed in the <cite><a href="https://jowritesstuff.wordpress.com/2015/01/24/strong-female-characters-belle/">Beauty and the Beast (1991)</a></cite>. She is a young adult who has an everlasting aspiration to gain knowledge and read. She is one of the most relatable princesses since her character was inspired by the women's rights movement. Belle is a role model for young girls growing up in society and a much needed change during that time, given that women were fighting for more autonomy and rights. Her attitude towards learning and encouragement for everyone else to gain knowledge is what I find to be the most admirable quality she possesses. Belle broke the gender mold that indicated women had to marry in order to gain some sort of empowerment. Belle's portrayal in this Disney movie, also claims and advertises the idea that "what's inside matters" more than exterior appearance which leads to the idea that women shouldn't be objectified but valued due to the equal intellect.</p>
	<h3>Why Belle Inspires Me:</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>She LOVES books (so do I)!</li>
    	<li>She loves and is kind towards animals, which is a plus.</li>
    	<li>She's a problem solver and an innovator.</li>
    	<li>Her two main outfits consist of blue and yellow which are two of my favorite colors.</li>
    	<li>She is very logical as well as a great teacher.</li>
    	<li>She isn't obsessed with finding a husband in order to escape her life. She doesn't rely on a man to save her.</li>
    	<li>She doesn't care about appearances.</li>
    	<li>She's adaptable, talking objects didn't phase her.</li>
    	<li class="imp">And lastly, again, because she LOVES books!</li>
    </ul>
